# Is This Diya Nair?
### A Personal Universe

An interactive constellation of everything that makes me who I am—my passions, my people, my places, and my dreams.

## About This Project

This is my universe visualized: a cosmic map of the things and people that define me. Navigate through glowing stars floating in deep space—each one representing a piece of my identity. Columbia. Family. Friends. Love. Manhattan. Music. Food. Travel. Fun. Singing. And somewhere ahead, a corporate future waiting to be written.

Each star is connected to others, showing how these parts of my life interweave and shape each other. Click on any star to explore that world within my universe.
